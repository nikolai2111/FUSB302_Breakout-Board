# FUSB302_Breakout-Board
This is a very simple and low level (without anything) breakout board for the FUSB302B Programmable USB Type-C Controller chip. Actually it is a breakout board for the footprint WQFN14 with only the footprint on it.  The project was implemented with KiCAD, it contains ready-to-use Gerber files.
